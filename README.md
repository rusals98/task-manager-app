This project utilizes Express.js, Node.js, Mongoose, Postman, Robo3t, MongoDB, MongoDB Compass, MongoDB Atlas, Heroku, Jest, and several different NPM packages. 

The purpose of this app was to develop a task manager application that would allow users to create an account and manage tasks through 15 different REST API endpoints.

Some of its features include JWT authentication, environment variables, promises, async/await functions, data validation/sanitization, password hashing, file uploads, sending out emails, sorting/paginating/filtering data, and unit tests to ensure all of the REST API endpoints are working as intended.

The production URL is: https://shrestha-task-manager-app.herokuapp.com
